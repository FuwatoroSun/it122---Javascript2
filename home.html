    <h1>Miho's Spring 2022 IT122 Page</h1>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to my my portal page. My name is Miho Suzuki. I'm an international student from Japan. I was a student of Japanese university, and my major was economic. However, I realized that my interest was not economics but computer programming. So I decided to come here and study computer science. <br>I've studied HTML/CSS and PHP on my own, but Javascript is a new field for me.</p>
